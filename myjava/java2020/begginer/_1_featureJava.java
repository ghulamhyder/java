/*1->*Platform independent you can develop the Java program on any computer system and execucation
 of that program is possible on any other computer system loaded with the JVM for example.
  You can write compile the Java program of Windows 98 and execute the compiled program on JVM 
   of the Macintosh operating system.


2->Object oriented Java is a true object oriented language which provide a platform to develop 
in effective and efficient application in program real life complexity. Most of the object oriented 
concepts in Java are the inherited from the c++ which make it easy for traditional programs to
 understand it.

3->Easy to learn Java is easy to learn for programmers because it is a sentence similar to
 C and C++ and most of the complex parts of the C and C++ have been included including 
 operator overloading multiple inheritance and pointer the important addition in java is automatic
  memory allocation and deallocation

4->*Robust* Java programmers need to remember to allocate memory in programs since there is a garbage
 collection mechanism, which handled the allocation of memory it provide powerful robust exception
  handling a mechanism to deal with the box expected and unexpected error at runtime

5->*Secure* Java is intended to work in the networked in distributed environments by providing security 
all the references to memory are the symbolic references meaning that the user is not aware where
 in the memory program is present.

6->*Multi-threaded-* the ability of an individual program to do more than one things at the same time 
is most efficiently implemented through Threads have a browser for instance can print A file in the 
background while it is download a page in one window and format the page as it downloads.

7->*Dynamic-* if you are compiling a file That depends on the other non-compiled files then the 
compiler will try to find and compile them also.

8->*High-performance-* Java is a fast interpreted language. java  offere two flavours of programing  
Java applets and JAVA application aplates are the small Java program mostly that can be download our
\ computer network and Run from a web page by using the java enabled browser like Netscape Microsoft
 Internet Explorer aplate used to add the dynamic features like the animation sound etc to web pages.*/
